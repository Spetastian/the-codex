[{"title":"Deathtouch","text":"'Deathtouch' is a static ability that causes a creature to be destroyed as a result of having been dealt damage by a source with deathtouch. In this way, for a creature with deathtouch, any nonzero amount of damage it deals to another creature is considered enough to kill it.  Deathtouch appears mostly on black cards and green cards.  Prior to the introduction of the keyword, similar abilities have appeared mostly on green and black cards, but in most cases those abilities were functionally different (typically triggering on combat damage andor at end of combat). This ability was first printed on a single timeshifted creature from 'Future Sight', mtgcardThornweald Archer. Older cards with this ability, such as mtgcardCruel Deceiver, were not changed to gain deathtouch. If a 1515 was blocked by a 11 with deathtouch, both would die"},{"title":"Defender","text":"Creatures with 'defender' can't attack.  This ability was formerly associated with Walls, as the creature type Wall had implicit 'rules baggage' that prevented such creatures from attacking.

It would also destroy a 22 creature, though be destroyed itself because the opposing creature survived the first strike to deal its own damage.  As with first strike, double strike appears mostly on red and white cards.  Double strike was first keyworded in 'Legions' and first used in a Core Set in 'Tenth Edition'."},{"title":"Enchant","text":"This ability is written 'Enchant (quality)' and appears on Auras, a subtype of enchantments. An Aura enters the battlefield attached to a permanent with the quality of its Enchant ability, and can only be attached to a permanent with that quality. If an Aura is not attached to a permanent with the required quality (such as if the object it enchants leaves the battlefield), it is put into its owner's graveyard. Like #Protectionprotection, the quality can be almost anything, but it normally has a permanent type associated with it, such as 'Enchant creature.' This ability was formerly seen in the type line instead of 'Enchantment&nbsp;— Aura.' The wording changed in the 'Ninth Edition' core set, which introduced the Aura subtype."},{"title":"Equip","text":"This ability is written 'Equip (cost)'.  It is found only on Equipment, a subtype of artifacts that first appeared in 'Mirrodin'.  A player may pay the Equip cost as a sorcery (only during his or her own main phase when the stack is empty) to attach it to a creature he or she controls. That creature becomes 'equipped' and can then be referenced by the Equipment as the 'equipped creature.' If the Equipment is already attached to a creature, its controller may pay the Equip cost again to move it to another creature. However, the Equipment cannot simply be 'dropped' by the equipped creature by paying the Equip cost. When a creature leaves the battlefield or stops being a creature by some effect, any Equipment attached to it 'falls off,' becoming unattached but remaining on the battlefield. Similarly, an Equipment that becomes a creature will 'fall off' a creature it is attached to. On the other hand, Equipment does not 'fall off' if another player gains control of either the creature or the Equipment. In the first case, the original controller still controls the Equipment, and so can pay the Equip cost to move it to a creature he or she still controls. In the second case, the original controller still controls the creature, but the other player can pay the Equip cost to move the Equipment to a creature he or she controls."},{"title":"First strike","text":"Creatures with 'first strike' deal damage before other creatures in combat.

Haste is an example of a retroactive keywording, as cards from almost every earlier set have possessed 'may attack the turn [they] come into play' or 'unaffected by summoning sickness,' which was replaced by the word 'haste.' It was later changed to include untapping to activate abilities as well.  Creatures with haste are most often red."},{"title":"Hexproof","text":"'Hexproof' is a static ability of permanents and players. A player or permanent with hexproof cannot be the target of spells or abilities controlled by that player's opponents (or that permanent's controller's opponents). This is similar to #Shroudshroud, but it does not deny the player (or his or her allies) the ability to target his or her own hexproof permanents.

They can still be countered, exiled, returned to the hand or library, sacrificed, or killed with effects that give negative toughness.  Indestructible is now a keyword, not anymore a quality that's true about a permanent, meaning that the indestructible ability can now be removed from a card, making it susceptible to being destroyed(23). Indestructible first appeared in 'Darksteel', chiefly among artifacts made of the titular metal, and has appeared in colored creatures in subsequent sets."},{"title":"Lifelink","text":"Permanents with 'lifelink' cause their controller to gain life whenever they deal damage. Lifelink as a keyword was introduced in 'Future Sight', though the ability itself already existed on numerous cards, which were all issued rules errata to have or grant lifelink. Cards with similar abilities, such as mtgcardSpirit Link, were not changed in this way. Lifelink was a triggered ability when it was issued but is now a static ability due to the 'Magic 2010' rules changes. Cards that previously had a lifelink-like ability have been issued further errata to return them to their original functionality (the lone exception to this is the Mirrodin card mtgcardLoxodon Warhammer, which, since it was reprinted in Tenth Edition with the lifelink keyword, retains that rather than the original functionality on all editions).  Lifelink is found mostly on white cards, and secondarily on black cards."},{"title":"Menace","text":"A creature with 'menace' can't be blocked except by two or more creatures.

Reach is found primarily in green creatures, especially Spiders."},{"title":"Scry","text":"To 'scry X', a player looks at the top X cards of his or her library, then puts any number of them on the bottom of their library and the rest on top in any order. Scry originally appeared in 'Fifth Dawn' as a keyword ability, primarily on instants and sorceries as 'Scry 2,' though it was designed to allow other values. 'Future Sight' added values 'Scry 1' through 'Scry 4' and redefined scry to be a keyword action, allowing it to be placed in the middle of an ability rather than as a 'tack-on' to other abilities. Scry then appeared in the Core Set 'Magic 2011', becoming the first mechanic to be revisited in a core set. Scry also returned in Theros Block before becoming an evergreen keyword in Magic Origins.As of Pro Tour 2015 in Vancouver, the Scry mechanic was introduced to the official tournament rules when taking a mulligan.  After all mulligans have resolved, any player whose opening hand contains fewer cards than their starting hand size may Scry 1.

For example, under normal circumstances, if a 63 attacker is blocked by a 11 creature, the attacker's 6 damage is all directed at the defending creature, despite it being only able to take 1 damage before being killed.  If, however, the attacker has trample, the attacking player may choose to have the difference (in this case, 5) between the attacker's power and the defenders' total toughness 'trample over' and be assigned to the defending player; this choice is to be made by the attacking player, and circumstances can arise in which 'overkilling' the blocking creature is a more advantageous move. Even if the blocker does not take the damage (if it is prevented, for instance) the trample damage is still assigned to the defending player. Trample only applies when a creature with trample is attacking; if a 63 creature with trample 'blocks' a 11 attacker, the blocker's extra 5 damage cannot be assigned to the attacking player. Creatures with trample are most often green or red."},{"title":"Vigilance","text":"'Vigilance' is a keyword of an ability that existed as far back as 'Alpha (Magic: The Gathering)Limited Edition Alpha' with mtgcardSerra Angel, but was retroactively keyworded beginning with the 'Kamigawa' block. Creatures with vigilance do not tap when attacking (Prior to being keyworded, these creatures' rules text read 'Attacking doesn't cause this creature to tap'), meaning they can still be used during the opponent's turn to block. Most creatures with vigilance are white."},{"title":"Attach","text":"The term 'attach' is used primarily on cards which can provide effects to certain other cards for an indeterminate amount of time, particularly Auras (see #EnchantEnchant), Equipment (see #EquipEquip), and Fortifications (see #FortifyFortify). These types of cards are used by designating something (usually a permanent) for them to be 'attached' to."},{"title":"Counter","text":"To 'counter' a spell or ability is to remove it from the stack without resolving its effects, putting it directly into its owner's graveyard. Some spells and abilities have an additional clause that replaces the graveyard with another game zone, such as mtgcardRemand. There are instant spells that will explicitly counter other spells, generally known as 'counterspells' after the original card with the effect: mtgcardCounterspell. Spells and abilities that have one or more targets are also countered by the game rules if they no longer have any legal targets, as would be the case if a targeted creature was returned to its owner's hand or if it gained hexproof. A spell that is countered this way is said to have 'fizzled.' Some cards specify that they 'cannot be countered by spells or abilities.' This only prevents the explicit method of countering spells; such a spell can still be countered by the game rules."},{"title":"Exile","text":"To 'exile' a card is to put it into the exile zone, usually as part of a card's effect. With few exceptions, exiled cards can no longer have an effect on the game. Starting from the 'Magic 2010' rules changes, cards that 'remove [something] from the game' or 'set [something] aside' were issued errata to say 'exile [something]' instead."},{"title":"Fight","text":"When two creatures 'fight' each other, each creature deals damage equal to its power to the other creature. Multiple creatures may fight each other at the same time. Fight is a keyword action that has been sporadically printed in some form since the card Gargantuan Gorilla, but it was not keyworded until 'Innistrad'."},{"title":"Regenerate","text":"'Regenerate' describes a replacement effect for destruction, is generally written as 'Cost: Regenerate (this permanent)', and is an ability only held by permanents. When the ability is activated, a 'regeneration shield' is set up on the permanent. The next time that permanent would be destroyed, instead (if applicable) all damage is removed from it, it is removed from combat, it is tapped, and a regeneration shield is removed from it. Otherwise, the regeneration shield remains until the end of the turn. This ability is generally found on creatures, though any permanent can be regenerated."},{"title":"Sacrifice","text":"To 'sacrifice' a permanent is to put it into its owner's graveyard. A player can only sacrifice a permanent he or she controls. Note that this term is separate from other ways permanents can be put into their owners' graveyards, such as destruction (meaning regeneration has no effect on sacrifice) and state-based actions (a creature having 0 toughness, for example).  Players are not allowed to sacrifice unless prompted to by a game effect."},{"title":"TapUntap","text":"To 'tap' a permanent is to rotate the card 90 degrees. This indicates it is being used, often as a cost, or to indicate that a creature is attacking (except for creatures with #Vigilancevigilance). Creatures a player controls that have not been under his or her control since the beginning of his or her most recent turn are said to have #Haste'summoning sickness' and cannot be tapped for their abilities that include the 'tap symbol,' nor can they attack, but they can be tapped for costs that use the word 'tap' (for example, 'Tap two untapped creatures you control').To 'untap' a permanent is to return it to a vertical orientation, allowing it to be tapped again. A tapped permanent must be untapped before it can be tapped again. However, as introduced in the 'Shadowmoor' block, untapping can also be a cost for activated abilities. It has its own special untap symbol (often called 'Q'), and is separate from normal untapping. To pay a cost including the untap symbol, the permanent must be already tapped. If that permanent is also a creature, then, as with the tap symbol, that ability can only be used if the creature has been under its controller's control since the beginning of his or her most recent turn.==Keywords from Expert-Level expansions (mechanics) The following are keywords currently in use in the Magic: The Gathering setscard sets other than the Core Sets and the 'Un'-sets (parody card sets; See 'Unglued'). Internally, expert-level keywords would appear in one block and are never used again; a major exception is the Time Spiral (Magic: The Gathering)Time Spiral block, which re-used many keyword mechanics from Magic's history due to its 'nostalgia' theme.Since then the design and development teams have reconsidered this policy and have made it habit to re-use old mechanics that they feel they can explore in new ways, contribute to flavor, or fix old mechanics and make them better. Examples being the Innistrad block, which used Flashback; and the Theros block, which uses Scry and remade the Chroma mechanic as Devotion."},{"title":"Absorb","text":"This ability is written 'absorb X'.

Older cards with this ability were not changed to grant absorb."},{"title":"Affinity","text":"This ability is written 'Affinity for (quality)'. A card with affinity costs 1 generic mana less to cast for each permanent with that quality under the caster's control.  For instance, a mtgcardFrogmite, which is an artifact creature that costs 4 generic mana and has 'Affinity for Artifact (Magic: The Gathering)artifacts', would be free if the player casting it controls four or more artifacts, whereas mtgcardThoughtcast, a sorcery with a printed cost of 4 generic mana and 1 blue mana, will cost a single blue mana regardless of whether its caster controls four or five (or more) artifacts. Affinity appeared throughout the 'Mirrodin' block, usually for artifacts.  A cycle of five cards in 'Darksteel' had affinity for each of the basic land types."},{"title":"Amplify","text":"This ability is written 'Amplify X'. As a creature with amplify enters the battlefield, its controller may reveal any number of creature cards in his or her hand that share a creature type with the creature.

A creature with this ability has banding, but can only band with creatures that have the same ability, e.g. are of the creature type or sub-type (quality), are of the color (quality), and so on.  Unlike normal banding, in an attacking band only one creature is required to have the 'bands with other (quality)' ability, so long as all other creatures in the band have the specified quality.  All other banding rules apply.Prior to the rules revisions made with the release of 'Magic 2010', 'bands with other' worked in a significantly different manner.  Rather than limiting a creature with this ability to banding with other creatures with the specified quality, the ability instead required all creatures in the band to have the same 'bands with other (quality)' ability or regular banding. The limitations (and counter-intuitiveness) of the ability under these rules led to 'bands with other' being called 'possibly the worst keyworded ability of all time' by 'Magic' rules manager Mark Gottlieb in the article 'Absurd or Ridiculous?

It's an Aura spell with enchant creature, so you have to target a creature to cast it. If the creature it targets leaves the battlefield before the bestow card resolves, or after the bestow card is already enchanting the creature, the bestow card enters the battlefield as an enchantment creature, unlike a regular aura card which would become unattached and go to the graveyard.

Flip cards enter the battlefield unflipped, with only the former set of attributes applying. Once certain conditions are met, the player 'flips' the card (by rotating it 180 degrees) into a different version—the latter set of attributes are now in effect.

At the time a player discards a card with madness, he or she may pay its madness cost and cast the card. Madness first appeared in 'Torment (Magic: The Gathering)Torment', and the rules for madness were subtly shifted for the reappearance of madness in 'Time Spiral (Magic: The Gathering)Time Spiral' block, where the vast majority of madness cards were black. A madness cost is usually cheaper than the normal mana cost of a card, but the 'Future Sight' set introduced a card whose madness cost is more expensive than its normal cost (mtgcardIchor Slick).

They can attack and block, and spells and abilities that target creatures can target them. They can be enchanted by Auras and equipped by Equipment.However, if the face-down creature's card is a creature card then it can be turned face-up for its full mana cost whether it has this ability on its own or not. This is a function of it being a manifest-ed creature card as opposed to a manifest-ed card of another type. If the card (of any type) happens to have the morph ability, the controller has the choice of using the morph ability on the card can turn the card face-up. Megamorph is treated the same way. These uses of morph and megamorph are considered 'special actions' and do not hit the stack.As always, any face down card must be revealed to go to any zone.

Morph was introduced in the 'Onslaught (Magic: The Gathering)Onslaught' block.Only creatures with morph may be played face-down. If a card without morph is turned face down by an effect, it can't be turned face up, because it has no morph ability with which to do so.

First, a defending player determines how combat damage is dealt by an opposing creature if at least one of the creatures blocking the opposing creature has banding; normally the controller of the creature dealing the damage determines this. Second, an attacking player may form 'bands' of creatures with banding, though one non-banding creature can be included in a band. If one creature in the band becomes blocked, the whole band becomes blocked as well, whether or not the defender could block other creatures in the band. This can allow many small creatures to 'gang up' on a single bigger creature that would survive blocking any one of these smaller creatures.Banding appears primarily in white.

The keyworded ability was only printed on blue cards, and in the 'islandhome' variety. The last card to be printed with a keyworded landhome ability was mtgcardManta Ray from 'Weatherlight'.Landhome is unique in that it is the only printed keyworded ability to later be retroactively removed from the rules.

A creature with this ability can not be blocked as long as the defending player controls at least one land with the printed land type (e.g. a creature with 'swamp'walk can not be blocked if the opponent has a swamp on the battlefield). This ability is somewhat rare, with swampwalk and plainswalk being the most common and least common, respectively. Landwalk is not limited to the five basic lands; for example, cards with 'legendary' landwalk, 'snow' landwalk, and 'nonbasic' landwalk have been printed. Landwalk was discontinued starting in Magic Origins."},{"title":"Protection","text":"This ability is written as 'Protection from (quality)'.  A creature with protection from a quality cannot be enchanted, equipped, blocked, or targeted by anything with that quality, and all damage that would be dealt by a source of that quality is prevented, barring exceptions which explicitly state otherwise. For example, a creature with protection from red cannot be enchanted by red Auras, blocked by red creatures, targeted by red spells and abilities, or take damage from red sources. A common mnemonic for which effects are prevented by protection is the acronym ''DEBT'', standing for 'Damage, Enchant (or Equip), Block, Target'. Note that the protection ability does not prevent effects that do not target. For example, though mtgcardBlack Knight has protection from white, it would still be destroyed by mtgcardWrath of God since Wrath of God does not target a creature.If a creature gains protection while some of these effects are present, different things may happen. Any Aura, Equipment, or Fortifications attached to it that are no longer legally attached to it 'fall off', becoming unattached (for example, a creature with a red Aura gains protection from red or a creature with an Equipment attached gains protection from artifacts). Auras that are not attached to anything are then put into their owners' graveyards, while Equipment and Fortifications stay on the battlefield. Any spells of that quality (or abilities of permanents of that quality) that target it lose that creature as a target (for example, a creature gained protection from red in response to being targeted with mtgcardLightning Bolt). If they no longer have any legal targets, the spell 'fizzles' and is countered by the game rules. However, a creature gaining protection in response to being blocked by a creature does not cause it to become unblocked, though it will prevent all damage that blocking creature would do to the creature with protection.Initially this ability was limited to 'Protection from (color),' but was later expanded to allow 'Protection from artifacts' in 'Urza's Legacy', and officially expanded to allow 'Protection from (quality)' in 'Invasion (Magic: The Gathering)Invasion' with the printing of mtgcardShoreline Raider.  In 'Alara blockConflux', a card called mtgcardProgenitus has 'Protection from everything'—meaning it cannot be blocked, cannot be equipped or enchanted, cannot be targeted by spells or abilities, and cannot be dealt damage. Most cards with protection are either white or an enemy color from the color of protection offered (i.e. most cards with protection from blues are blue's enemies of red and green). Since the release of Magic Origins, Protection has been called a deciduous effect, meaning that it's a tool in WOTC's toolbox that they are allowed to use, but it's not something they expect to use in every set."},{"title":"Regenerate","text":"Playing the regeneration cost on a creature with regenerate that received a lethal amount of damage would tap that creature (if it was untapped) and prevent that creature form being set to the graveyard."},{"title":"Shroud","text":"A player or permanent with 'shroud' cannot be the target of spells or abilities (even his or her own). While the keyword 'shroud' was introduced in 'Future Sight', the ability itself existed long before, first appearing on mtgcardSpectral Cloak; cards which featured this ability were all issued rules errata to have or grant 'shroud.' Creatures with shroud are most often blue or green.  Today it has been supplanted completely by the more flexible #HexproofHexproof."},{"title":"Substance","text":"'Substance' was a static ability with no effect which was never printed on a 'Magic' card.

These cards were all enchantments that could be played as instants, but only lasted for a turn if played as an instant. Under the newer rules, the original wording would cause the enchantment to leave the battlefield before damage was removed from creatures.
